Notes
-----

Rebuild SiteSearch.USiteSearch.PostBuildActions. This builds the nuget file in SiteSearch.USiteSearch

Note that SiteSearch.USiteSearch does not have the checkbox 'Produce a package file during 
build operations' checked

why you cant copy file nuget files to a folder

One common approach is to use a cryptographic hash function to create a unique fingerprint of the license key. The fingerprint can then be stored on the licensing server or in the package itself, and the package can verify the fingerprint of the entered key against the stored fingerprint to determine if the key is valid. This approach can provide a high level of security, but it requires the use of a secure cryptographic hash function and may not be suitable for all scenarios.
